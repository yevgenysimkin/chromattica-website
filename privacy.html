        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Chromattica uses the Chromium codebase to provide access for you to reach various destinations on the Internet. It doesn't have any control over what you find at those destinations. It's not responsible for how often you stumble across the kind of stuff that gives the Internet the reputation that it has. We store very little about you. What we do store is your email and the websites that you choose to set as your permanent utilities, and we encrypt that data in our database so really it's useless to anyone who might steal it.</p>

        <p>We're not interested in you (even though you're VERY VERY interesting!) and we're not selling your information to anyone (and again - we don't really know anything useful about you that anyone would want to buy).</p>

        <p>At this time we're not putting ads into the application but if we ever do, those will just be random ads served to random people, with no specific targeting because you can't target when you have no actual data about the target.</p>

        <p>There are a few things in the app that are native to Chromattica, like the project clock that we added to help you track how much time you're spending doing this or that. This information is probably highly valuable to someone (who knows?!) but the point is that it's not for sale and it'll never be for sale and if you want it deleted we'll make it very easy for you to delete it. But again - it's stuff like "youtube:14h12m13s" - is that something someone might want to know about you? Maybe. But we're not gonna' divulge it.</p>

        <p>Oh, and that whole feature is totally optional - it's there for you to track your habits and/or your work - it's not there for us to know how much time you pretend to work while doom scrolling Facebook.</p>

        <p>If you're a California resident, you have the right to ask us what data we have about you and to request that we delete it. The answer to the first question is "almost nothing" and the answer to the second is "happily." Just email us.</p>

        <p>This product is not intended for children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect data from anyone under 13. If you're under 13 and somehow reading a privacy policy for fun, you are a very unusual child and we respect that, but please go do something more age-appropriate.</p>

        <p>So - that's about it. You have your privacy, we have our privacy - if you use Chromattica to post pictures of your junk on Pornhub, we're not responsible (and we're telling you right now that this is a terrible idea, but hey - it's your junk and it's your Pornhub, so it's none of our business).</p>

        <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or want to request deletion of your data, you can reach Genia at <a href="mailto:genia@chromattica.com">genia@chromattica.com</a>.</p>
