            You have seven email accounts, four Slack workspaces, and a LinkedIn you log into once a year out of guilt. Your browser wasn't built for this. Chromattica was.
        </p>
        <p class="hero-sub">
            A multi-profile Chromium browser that keeps your work, personal, freelance, and "I swear this is research" lives completely separate. Each profile gets its own cookies, sessions, and apps &mdash; no cross-contamination, no logging in and out, no existential dread.

        <h2 class="features-heading">What makes it different</h2>
        <p class="features-sub">It's a browser, but with opinions about how your digital life should work.</p>

                <div class="feature-icon">&#127912;</div>
                <h3>Color-Coded Profiles</h3>
                <p>Each profile gets its own color, avatar, and complete browser isolation. Switch between Work-You and Weekend-You without logging out of anything.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>App Dock</h3>
                <p>Pin your most-used web apps per profile. Gmail, Slack, Notion, that one internal tool with the terrible URL &mdash; they're all one click away, organized by the life they belong to.</p>

                <h3>Built-In Time Tracking</h3>
                <p>Know exactly how long you spend in each app and profile. Great for freelancers, billable hours, or finally quantifying your doom-scrolling habit.</p>

                <h3>Password Manager Integration</h3>
                <p>LastPass and Bitwarden built right in. No extension to install, no separate app to alt-tab to. Your credentials, where you need them.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Chromium Under the Hood</h3>
                <p>Full Chromium engine. Your extensions work. Your bookmarks work. DevTools work. It's the browser you know, organized the way you actually use it.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Pay What You Want</h3>
                <p>Seriously. If you can afford $25, great. If you can't, just tell me you like it and it's yours. A portion of proceeds funds <a href="https://samizdatonline.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SamizdatOnline.org</a> &mdash; breaking through censorship walls so people in Russia and Iran can read whatever they want.</p>

            Chromattica is built by <strong style="color: var(--text);">one person</strong> who got tired of Chrome's "profile switcher" pretending that dropdown menu counts as a feature. It's a real app, with real engineering, maintained by a real human who reads every email you send him.
